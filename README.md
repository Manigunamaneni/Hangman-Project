# Hangman Game 🎮

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman Game using Python.

## 📜 Description

The player correctly guesses all letters in the word (You Win! 🎉).
The player runs out of lives (You Lose! ❌).
## 🛠 Features

Random word selection from a predefined list.
Player input handling with case insensitivity.
Lives tracking and game over conditions.
